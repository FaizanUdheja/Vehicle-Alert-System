# 🚗 Vehicle Alert System

An IoT-based **Vehicle Alert System** built on **Raspberry Pi 4** to improve driver and passenger safety.
The system integrates sensors, machine learning, and computer vision to provide **real-time alerts** and prevent accidents.

## ✨ Features

1. 🚨 **Accident Detection & SMS Alert**

   * Detects sudden impact or collision using an **accelerometer**.
   * Sends **emergency SMS** with GPS location via GSM module to predefined contacts.

2. 🛑 **Traffic Sign Recognition (Driver Assist)**

   * Uses a **Machine Learning model (CNN trained on GTSRB dataset)** to detect traffic signs.
   * Assists drivers by alerting them to **speed limits, stop signs, and other signals**.

3. 🌫️ **Fog/Obstacle Detection**

   * Detects obstacles ahead in **low-visibility conditions** (fog, dark, or poor weather) using an **ultrasonic sensor**.
   * Provides instant **voice/audio alerts** to the driver.

4. 😴 **Drowsiness Detection**

   * Monitors driver’s eyes using **Pi Camera + OpenCV**.
   * Triggers an **alarm/voice alert** if the driver shows signs of fatigue or sleepiness.
